# ChessCraft v0.3.1

ChessCraft is a Bukkit plugin that allows you to play chess on your CraftBukkit Minecraft server.
 
## Installation

The notes below apply to released versions.  "pre" versions do not supply a pre-compiled JAR file, but you can "git clone" the source and build it
yourself.  Please only do this if you're prepared for possibly broken functionality and/or you want to contribute!

1) Copy ChessCraft.jar into your Bukkit plugins/ folder.

2) Restart/reload your server.

3) If you're upgrading from a version of ChessCraft prior to v0.3, you can if you wish remove Chesspresso-lib.jar from your Bukkit lib/ directory.
Chesspresso is now distributed as part of ChessCraft and a separate download is no longer required.
